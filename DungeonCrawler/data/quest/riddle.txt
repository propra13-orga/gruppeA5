Good to see you again.
We do not have the time to play around any longer.	
 
The dungeon in this forest has been roamed for many years
by a sorcerer, more vicious than you can imagine.
After all the time his madness has spread amongst the animals 
that live in these woods. 

I need you to go to the third part of this forest.
Kill all the monsters there are and tell me how many there were.
 
 
 
five
six 
seven
eight

Your Discovery is quite alarming!
 
It seems the sorcerers force has increased a lot
over the last months.
We have to act fast. 
I need you to enter the Dungeon!

Go to the first Room of the Dungeon and pick up the items you see.
Afterwards come back to me and tell me how many there were.

three

five
back 
 
 
 
Now go deeper into the dungeon! 
 
On your way to the sorcerer 
you will encounter one of his more powerful minions!
Slay the dragon and tell me his true name!
