Good to see you again.
We do not have the time to play around any longer.	
 
The dungeon in this forest has been roamed for many years
by a sorcerer, more vicious than you can imagine.
After all the time his madness has spread amongst the animals 
that live in these woods. 

I need you to go to the third part of this forest.
Kill all the monsters there are and tell me how many there were.
